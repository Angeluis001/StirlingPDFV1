This is a powerful locally hosted web based PDF manipulation tool using docker that allows you to perform various operations on PDF files, such as splitting merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more. This locally hosted web application started as a 100% ChatGPT-made application and has evolved to include a wide range of features to handle all your PDF needs.

Stirling PDF makes no outbount calls for any record keeping or tracking.

All files and PDFs are either purely client side, in server memory only during the execution of the task or within a temporay file only for execution of the task.
Any file which has been downloaded by the user will have already been deleted from the server by that time.

Feel free to request any features or bug fixes either in github issues or our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cn8pWhQRxZ)

## Customize App
Stirling PDF allows easy customization of the visible application name.
Simply use environment variables APP_HOME_NAME, APP_HOME_DESCRIPTION and APP_NAVBAR_NAME with Docker or Java. 
If running Java directly, you can also pass these as properties using -D arguments.

Using the same method you can also change 

- The default language by providing APP_LOCALE with values like de-DE fr-FR or ar-AR (Note the - character not _ ) to select your default language (Will always default to English on invalid locale) Current accepted locales can be seen above in the Want to add your own language section
- Enable/Disable search engine visiblility with ALLOW_GOOGLE_VISIBILITY with true / false values. Default disable visiblility.
- Change root URI for Stirling-PDF ie change server.com/ to server.com/pdf-app by running APP_ROOT_PATH as pdf-app
- Disable and remove endpoints and functionality from Stirling-PDF. Currently the endpoints ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE and GROUPS_TO_REMOVE can include comma seperated lists of endpoints and groups to disable as example ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages would disable both image to pdf and remove pages, GROUPS_TO_REMOVE=LibreOffice Would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups [here](https://github.com/Frooodle/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Groups.md)
